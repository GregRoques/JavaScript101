    jQuery is a JavaScript Library â€“ meaning IT IS JavaScript. It is a library, similar to BootStrap.

    Allows you to change stuff, but DOES NOT keep track of the changes...it mutates the DOM.
    In a big app, this gets CONFUSING!!!
        ...React, Angular and view are the answer to this!
    
    jQuery directly manipulates the DOM.
    This is expensive (aka, it takes a lot of resources)
        ...React and others use a "virtual DOM," which is more efficient
    
    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
