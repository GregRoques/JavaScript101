    <!-- Scope determines what can see a variable

    Global - no parent; anyone can see it anywhere.
    if it belongs to the window or is outside all functions (just inside of a script tag)
    it is global. Think of it like a Super Variable – awesome for small programs or 
    when necessary. Dangerous!!!! ... when your program gets big.

    In Python - globals are variables that are all the way to the left (aka, not indented)

    LOCAL – live inside of functions and are visible and changeable only to that function
    and its child functions. -->

<!-- 
    STATES OF A VARIABLE
    - declared = JS knows it exists
    - undeclared = no var X anywhere
   - init/assigned = not only does it exist, it has a value -->

   <!-- =======================================================================================

   HOISTING – anytime you have the word VAR, JS will take the VAR and put it at the top of
   the fuction/global whether you like it or not -->

   <!-- in addition to VAR, JS got a facelift in 2015 that added "let" and "const" -->

   <!-- let + const = no more var -->
   <!-- let is a block level variable. It lives for as long as the brackets its inside of do. -->
    <!-- you can make globals with let if you do it outside of everything -->
